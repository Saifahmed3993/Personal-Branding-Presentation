            <h2>Module 1: Introduction to Personal Branding</h2>
            <h3>What is Personal Branding?</h3>
            <p>
                <b>Personal branding is what people say about you when you're not in the room.</b>
                It is the way you present yourself, your values, and your unique strengths to the world.
            </p>
            <h3>Why Personal Branding?</h3>
            <p>
                Think of your favorite brands: they are <b>memorable</b>, clear about their value, and
                <b>consistent in how they communicate</b>. In the same way, individuals can build their own
                identity through personal branding to <b>stand out in a crowded marketplace</b>.

            <h2>Pillars of a Powerful Personal Brand</h2>
            <p>
                A strong personal brand is built on four key pillars. Together, they help you create
                a brand that is memorable, trustworthy, and impactful.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Consistency (C):</b> Show up with the same message, tone, and values across all platforms.</li>
                <li><b>Authenticity (A):</b> Be true to who you are, what you believe, and what you care about.</li>
                <li><b>Expertise (E):</b> Demonstrate your skills and knowledge through valuable content and results.</li>
                <li><b>Visibility (V):</b> Be present where your audience is and communicate regularly.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Slide 6 – Authenticity -->
        <section id="slide6" class="slide">
            <h2>Authenticity</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Authenticity is about being true to yourself, your values, beliefs, and who you really are.</b>
                When you are authentic, you allow others to see the real you, which helps to build a deeper connection.
            </p>
            <p>
                When your audience resonates with your mission and values, they are more likely to become
                <b>loyal followers</b>. Transparency and honesty play a crucial role in building trust.
                In personal branding, <b>authenticity is key</b> to creating a strong and lasting brand.

        <!-- Slide 7 – Consistency -->
        <section id="slide7" class="slide">
            <h2>Consistency</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Consistency is the cornerstone of building a strong personal brand.</b>
                It is not just about what you say, but how you show up day after day across all platforms.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whether through social media posts, public appearances, or everyday conversations, maintaining a
                consistent image and message helps people clearly understand who you are and what you stand for.
                When you consistently deliver the same values, tone, and messaging, your audience finds it easier
                to connect with you and trust you.

        <!-- Slide 8 – Expertise & Visibility -->
        <section id="slide8" class="slide">
            <h2>Expertise & Visibility</h2>
            <p>
                Your personal brand should highlight your knowledge and skills. To position yourself as an expert,
                share valuable insights, offer real solutions, and show proof through testimonials, case studies,
                and practical work.
            </p>
            <p>
                Visibility is essential. Be active on the platforms where your audience spends time and engage
                consistently. Different platforms offer different opportunities:
            </p>
            <ul>
